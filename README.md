# Bike Sales Project
I Explored the bike sales data using Microsoft Excel. The Analysis includes:
Understanding the shape of the data, cleaning, and manipulating the data in order to create a dashboard which is given insights on:
*	The Average income of customers per purchase.
*	How customers’ ages influenced bike purchases.
*	How customers’ commutes influenced bike purchases.
*	The gender with the most purchases.

These insights can be filtered by customer education, marital status, and region.
